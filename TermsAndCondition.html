    their approach to data protection.

    practices in how we process your Personal Data. By using our Platform and
    Services, you agree to the handling of your Personal Data in accordance
    with this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. If you use our Platform and

    to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise
    interact with us to stay informed about our information practices, and the
    choices available to you.
</p>
<h3>1.6. Exclusion of Healthcare Services in our platform</h3>
<p>
    It is important to note, and as set out in our Terms of Use, that we are a
    platform provider. We do not provide any actual medical or other health
    services on our Platform. Nothing stated or posted on the Platform by us
    is intended to be, and must not be taken to be, the practice of medicine,
    dentistry, nursing, or other healthcare professional services or the
    provision of medical care. Do not use the Platform or the Services for
    emergency medical needs. If you experience a medical emergency,
    immediately call your local emergency services.
</p>
<p>
    Healthcare Providers who have registered and entered into a subscription
    agreement with us in relation to our appointment booking facility on the
    Platform will be subject to a service agreement with additional provisions
    as to how we will use Personal Data. We recommend that you look at the
    Healthcare Providers’ privacy policy to understand how they process your
    Personal Data.
</p>
<h3>2. Links to Other Sites</h3>
<h3>2.1. We are not responsible for third-party sites</h3>
<p>
    The Platform may include links to other third-party websites, plug-ins,
    and applications which may include those of Healthcare Providers. These
    other third-party websites are not owned or controlled by Power
    International Holding. We are not responsible for the privacy or security
    practices of such other third-party websites. When you leave our Platform,
    we strongly encourage you to read the Privacy Policy of each website that
    collects personally identifiable data, and to know your privacy rights
    before interacting with such websites.
</p>
<h3>2.2. White Label Solution</h3>
<p>
    We have partnered with certain Healthcare Providers who provide Afiya’s
    Services using a White Label Solution. In practice, this means that the
    Healthcare Providers’ website will contain a link to pages on our Platform
    and such pages will utilize the Healthcare Provider’s branding.
</p>
<h3>3. Your Data Protection Rights</h3>
<h3>3.1. Overview</h3>
<p>
    Power International Holding uses your Personal Data for several different
    purposes, for example to provide our Services to you and others and to
    meet our legal and regulatory obligations. By ‘your information/data’ we
    mean any information about you that you or third parties provide to us.
    You have rights under relevant data protection law, and these rights are
    explained in this section.
</p>
<h3>
    3.2. Right of access (also known as ‘Subject Access Request’ or ‘SAR’)
</h3>
<p>The right of access is your right to obtain from us:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Confirmation that we are only reading your Personal Data from the
        Hospital EMR; and
    </li>
    <li>
        The account owner’s details, documents, and existing relative details
        along with their documents are not stored in Afiya.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please refer to section 4 for the type of data we collect. If following an
    appointment, you require access to your medical data or your notes in
    respect of the appointment, we do not hold such data, but the information
    updated by the health provider via EMR will be accessible under ‘My
    Records’ feature and downloadable with specific consent.
</p>
<h3>3.3. Account Deletion - Apple OS</h3>
<p>
    In compliance with Apple’s App Store Guidelines, users who create an Afiya
    account may delete their account in addition to deactivating it.
</p>

<p>
    When you delete the Afiya application from your device, a deletion request
    is sent to our operations team who will carry out certain checks to
    ensure, for example, that the user has no upcoming appointments with a
    healthcare provider, and the third party (see section 2.2) is informed of
    such deletion request.
</p>
<p>
    The account deletion process is manual and therefore it will take up to 14
    working days to action the request from the date the request is received.
    An Email and SMS notification will be sent to the email address and phone
    number on the registered account as confirmation of receipt of the request
    and another confirmation will be sent upon successful deletion of the
    account.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that we are required to retain certain data by law and may
    retain certain data in accordance with statutory limitation periods.
</p>
<p>
    In the event that you decide to return to use Afiya services you can reuse
    the same phone number.
</p>
<h3>3.4. Our response to your requests</h3>
<p>
    We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
    Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is
    particularly complex, or you have made several requests. In this case, we
    will notify you and keep you updated. If you wish to exercise any of the
    data protection rights set out above, please contact us by email at
</p>
<a href="mailto:digitalteam@powerholding-intl.com"
>digitalteam@powerholding-intl.com</a
>
<h3>4.Data Acquisition</h3>
<p>
    The different kinds of Personal Data that we collect & do not store in our
    platform but transmit to the EMR of Health providers are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identity and Contact data: first name, last name, date of birth, gender,
        email address, telephone number, and ID.
    </li>
    <li>
        Financial and Transaction Data: details about payments from you, payment
        card details. For details about our payment collection options, please
        refer to our Terms and Conditions.
    </li>
    <li>Profile Data: your chosen password and bookings made by you.</li>
    <li>
        Usage Data/Online Identifiers: IP Addresses, information about how you
        use our Platform, products, and Services, how you use your devices to
        access our Platform including the screens you visit and searches you
        make
    </li>
    <li>
        Marketing and Communications Data: your preferences in receiving
        marketing from us and our third parties, and your communication
        preferences
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Where we need to collect Personal Data by law, or under the terms of a
    contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when
    requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are
    trying to enter into with you (e.g. to provide you with booking services).
    In this case, we may have to cancel an appointment you have booked through
    the Platform, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.
</p>
<h3>5. Minors</h3>
<p>
    By accessing, using and/or submitting information to or through the
    Platform and the Services, you represent that you are not a child, being a
    person under the age of 18 (“Minor”). If we learn that we have received
    any information directly from a Minor without his/her parent’s written
    consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that
    Minor (or his/her parent or legal guardian) to inform the Minor that
    he/she cannot use the Services, and we will subsequently delete that
    information. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a Minor, you may, in
    compliance with the Terms of Use, use the Services on behalf of such
    Minor. Any information that you provide us while using the Services on
    behalf of the Minor will be treated as Personal Data as otherwise provided
    herein. If you are a parent or legal guardian, and you allow a Minor to
    use the Services, then these terms (Terms of Service) apply to you, and
    you are responsible for the Minor’s activity on the Services. Please refer
    to our Terms of Service.
</p>
<h3>6. Consent</h3>
<p>
    Consent is one lawful basis for processing. When we ask for your consent,
    we do not use pre-ticked boxes. For example, when you register your
    account with us, you will need to read and accept our Privacy Policy and
    Terms of Use by ticking the ‘I agree’ box provided. This is known as
    positive opt in.
</p>
<strong>Here is an example:</strong>
<p>
    Please note that you may withdraw your consent at any time where we are
    relying on our consent to process your Personal Data. However, this will
    not affect the lawfulness of any process carried out before you withdraw
    your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
    certain products or Services to you. We will advise you if this is the
    case at the time you withdraw your consent.
</p>
<p>
    When you make an appointment using our Platform, the consultant, or the
    Healthcare Provider that you are seen in person would be responsible, as a
    data controller, for obtaining your consent and manage the consent
    process. You must contact the consultant or the clinical practice directly
    if you would like to withdraw your consent related to your appointment and
    consultation.
</p>
<h3>7. Marketing / Research</h3>
<h3>7.1. General</h3>
<p>
    We would like to send you information about our Services, and we use
    SMTP2GO for marketing purposes. If you have agreed to receive marketing,
    you may always opt-out later by following the opt-out/unsubscribe links on
    any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time by
    sending an email to
</p>
<a href="mailto:digitalteam@powerholding-intl.com"
>digitalteam@powerholding-intl.com</a
>
<p>
    Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not
    apply to Personal Data provided to us because of a product/service
    experience or other transactions.
</p>
<h3>7.2. Promotional offers from us</h3>
<p>
    We may use your identity, contact, technical, usage, and profile data to
    form a view of what we think you may want or need, or what may be of
    interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services, and
    offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). You will receive
    marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us
    or purchased services from us and you have not opted out of receiving that
    marketing.
</p>
<h3>7.3. Third-party marketing</h3>
<p>
    It is the responsibility of the third party, such as our White Label
    partners, to obtain your consent and get your express opt-in consent
    before they contact you for marketing purposes.
</p>
<h3>7.4. Mobile app push notifications</h3>
<p>
    On downloading the Afiya app, you will receive notifications asking
    whether you consent to: (a) Afiya identifying and using your mobile device
    location; and (b) to receiving future notifications from Afiya.
</p>
<h3>8. Data Security</h3>
<h3>8.1. General</h3>
<p>
    We process your data in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the
    Personal Data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful
    processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using
    appropriate technical or organizational measures. We also have procedures
    to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and
    any applicable regulator of a breach where required by law.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, no transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be
    completely secure, and transmission of information via the Internet is not
    completely secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction
    with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of
    any account you might have with us has been compromised), please
    immediately notify us of the problem using the contact details provided in
    section 9.

<p>

    reliability of any of the content or data found on this platform and Afiya

    viruses that may infect, your mobile or other equipment or other property
    on account of your access to, use of, or browsing on the website. In no
    event shall Afiya be liable for any injury, loss, claim, damages, or any
    exemplary, punitive, direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential

    savings) whether based in contract, tort, strict liability, negligence,
    product liability or otherwise. The entire risk as to the quality,
    performance and use of this website is with you. Any communications,

    address).
</h3>
<p>
    If you are provided with a password or any other piece of information as
    part of our security procedures for a registration-only section of our
    Platform, you are responsible for all activities that are carried out
    under them. We do not have the means to check the identities of people
    using the Platform and we will not be liable if your password or username,
    email address or your mobile number is used by someone else. You agree to
    contact us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or
    username of which you become aware. We have the right to disable any user
    identification code or password, whether chosen by you or allocated by us,
    at any time, if you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of
    these terms or the Terms of Use.
</p>
